#
# Avnet MiniZed pin constraints file.
#
# This script creates an array of key-value pairs for each port in
# the design using standard Tcl syntax. At the end of the script,
# the array is parsed, and the key-value pairs are applied to the
# design using Vivado commands.
#
# This script is based on the Avnet MiniZed XDC file;
#
# http://zedboard.org/sites/default/files/documentations/MiniZed_Constraints_Rev1_170613.zip
#
# This script contains the pin assignments for the Programmable
# Logic (PL) portion of the design. The Processor System (PS)
# pin assignments are defined by the Zynq First Stage Bootloader
# (FSBL).
#
# The MiniZed includes an FT2232H USB-to-UART bridge with the
# A-bus connected to JTAG and the B-bus connected to the PS UART.
# The A-bus signal AD[6] = FT_PS_POR_N and AD[7] = FT_PS_SRST_N
# could be connected to the board resets, but are not by default.
# The reset push button output (MR_N) connects to the power
# management controller (PMIC). The PMIC GPIOs connect to
# pull-downs and an unpopulated header. The PMIC reset output
# (PMIC_SYS_RST_N) connects to the FPGA PS reset input (p3 [2]).
# The FPGA PS clock input connects to a 33.33MHz clock.
#
# FPGA projects need the PS system configured to generate a clock
# to the PL.
#

# Notes
# ------
#
# 1. 'unmanaged' constraints file
#
#    This file is a Vivado 'unmanaged' constraints file. It will
#    not be modified by Vivado and supports all Tcl constructs.
#    XDC files support very limited Tcl syntax, eg., no
#    conditional logic.
#
# 2. Pin assignments are applied during implementation
#
#    If this file is added to a project, then Tcl puts output from
#    may appear in the following log files;
#
#    hdl\boards\xilinx\avnet_minized\blinky_osc\vwork\project_1.runs\synth_1\runme.log
#    hdl\boards\xilinx\avnet_minized\blinky_osc\vwork\project_1.runs\impl_1\runme.log
#
#    The Tcl command "set_property PACKAGE_PIN ..." should only be
#    used during implementation. The command will fail if called
#    during synthesis. To restrict this file to implementation
#    only, use the set_property command to set the constraints
#    file used_in_synthesis and used_in_simulation flags to false.
