# Avnet MiniZed 'blinky' Design

11/23/2017 D. W. Hawkins (dwh@caltech.edu)

The 'blinky' LED design is a minimal demonstration of the MiniZed board.
The design blinks the blue DONE LED and the bi-color green/red LED. The design
uses a 100MHz clock generated by a Zynq-7 PLL.

This design does not use the Zynq-7 processor block, however, it does include
an instance of the processor block to provide access to the FCLK clock and
reset outputs. The design assumes that the Zynq-7 has configured the PS-to-PL
PLL to generate 100MHz on FCLKCLK[0].

To synthesize the design;

* Start Vivado.
* Use the Tcl console to change directory to the project folder, eg.,
~~~~
tcl> cd {C:\github\d-hawkins\hdl\boards\xilinx\avnet_minized\blinky}
~~~~
* Source the synthesis script, i.e.,
~~~~
tcl> source scripts/synth.tcl
~~~~
* After the bit-file is generated, program the MiniZed board.
