# Introduction
This directory contains example designs for the Digilent Arty board.

Digilent provides an extensive reference manual and reference designs for this board - see the Resources below.

# Features

* Five clock management tiles, each with a phase-locked loop (PLL)
* 90 DSP slices (DSP48E1 with pre-add, 25x18-bit multiply, 48-bit post-add/accumulate)
* Internal clock speeds exceeding 450 MHz
* On-chip analog-to-digital converter (XADC)
* Digilent USB-JTAG port for FPGA programming and communication
* USB-UART Bridge
* 10/100 Mbps Ethernet
* 256MB DDR3L (16-bit bus at 667MHz)
* 16MB Quad-SPI Flash
* 4 user switches
* 4 user buttons
* 1 reset button
* 4 LEDs
* 4 RGB LEDs
* 4 Pmod connectors
* Arduino shield connector

# Notes
Random notes from the Digilent documentation:
* The board supports programming via JTAG and Quad-SPI flash (jumper selectable)
* The USB-UART is an FTDI FT2232HQ
* The two-channel FTDI FT2232HQ is used as a Digilent USB-JTAG programmer and a USB-UART
* The QSPI Flash is a 16Mbit Micron N25Q128A13ESF40 (bitfiles are around 16Mbit)
* The reference clock is a 100MHz oscillator connected to E3
* There are four PMOD connectors; two of them connect to the XADC inputs
* The Artix-7 XADC is a 1MSps 12-bit dual-channel ADC (see UG480 for details)
* The XC7A35T in CS324 does not have GTP transceivers
* The schematic does not include the FTDI interface (the page is missing)
* The Tutorials web page has links to multiple tutorials, which in turn link to the github repo containing the tutorial source
