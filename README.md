# Hardware Description Language (HDL) Repo

10/19/2016 D. W. Hawkins (dwh@caltech.edu)

This github repo hosts a range of HDL components for use with Altera, Xilinx, and Microsemi FPGAs.

The repository is split into a library of reusable IP components and a boards folder containing a range of different hardware targets.

Feel free to use these components in your own designs.
