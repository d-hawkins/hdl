This github repo hosts a range of HDL components and designs for use with a range of FPGA boards.

The repository is split into a library of reusable IP components and a boards folder containing a range of different hardware targets. The top-level layout is

| Directory         | Description                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
